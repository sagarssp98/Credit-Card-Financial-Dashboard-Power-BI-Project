# Credit-Card-Financial-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project
• Developed an end-to-end interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze credit card usage, built by integrating customer demographics and transaction data from a SQL Server database. The dashboard was designed with a user-friendly interface and tailored to support business teams in monitoring key financial behaviors.

• Performed extensive data cleaning and transformation using Power Query and DAX to prepare raw datasets for analysis. Tasks included handling missing values, normalizing transaction amounts, converting date formats, and deriving new calculated columns such as "Average Monthly Spend," "Payment-to-Spend Ratio," and "Customer Lifetime Value."

• Created multiple visual layers including dynamic filters, slicers, and drill-through reports to allow deep dives into:

Monthly and quarterly spend trends by customer segment, geography, and card type.

Payment behavior analysis including timely repayments, delinquencies, and minimum payments vs. full payments.

Customer segmentation using metrics such as transaction frequency, total spend, and repayment patterns (e.g., high spenders, revolvers, transactors).

• Defined and tracked KPIs like Total Spend, Active Users, Average Payment Delays, and Monthly Default Rates using cards, gauges, and line/bar charts, enhancing real-time monitoring of credit card performance.

• Enabled data-driven decision-making by delivering concise, actionable insights to stakeholders during review sessions. The dashboard helped business units identify underperforming customer segments and optimize reward programs and credit limits.

• Ensured scalability and performance optimization by designing efficient data models and using star schema structure to minimize report load times and improve interactivity.
